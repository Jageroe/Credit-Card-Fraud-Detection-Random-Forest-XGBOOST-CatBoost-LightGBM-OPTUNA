# Credit Card Fraud Detection - Random Forest, XGBOOST, CatBoost, LightGBM - OPTUNA

This project's aim is to experiment with ensemble models on an extremely imbalanced dataset for binary classifications. The hyperparameters of the models were optimized using Optuna.


## Data Source

The dataset for this project is from Kaggle's [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) competition.
